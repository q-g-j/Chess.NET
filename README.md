# Chess.NET
*A chess program for Windows written in C# for .NET Framework 4.7+*

### What's working so far (but needs testing):
- play alternately on the same computer
- rotate the board
- move validation
- check validation
- check mate validation
- en passant
- promote pawn
- castling

### TODO:
- draw validation
- network play (a dedicated server / client REST API implementation is in progress)
- use UCI chess engines
